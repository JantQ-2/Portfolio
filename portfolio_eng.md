Team size: 4 — Primary responsibility: gameplay systems

  ## What I Worked On

  Designed and implemented the dynamic wave system where new waves spawn after the previous one is cleared.
  Implemented weighted enemy selection so wave compositions vary and avoid repetition.
  Built the upgrade system, designed for fast iteration — adding a new upgrade typically takes only a few minutes.
  Implemented weighted upgrade selection to control progression and balance without hard-coding.
  Implemented difficulty scaling both per wave and for overall game difficulty.
  Developed core player systems including health, overhealing, and armor.
  Built a custom API to store scores and run data, mainly for leaderboards and additional gameplay statistics.
